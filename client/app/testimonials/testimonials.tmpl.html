            <p>We had the pleasure of staying at the TKS a few years ago. Everything from the valets to the rooms were wonderful! The outstanding breakfast started out our day. The Dolphin Quest was great. I only wish We were there right at this moment. We hope to be back very soon!.</p>

            <p>What an amazing hotel.We were greeted by Linda at the front desk with a warm friendly smile. We had booked a tour through the hotel to the Polynesian Cultural Center. Unfortunately, due to hurricane Iselle and Julio, our tour was cancelled. Between Carolyn (with two phones in her ear) and Mark, they made everything right. Instead, we took the shuttle into Waikiki and walked around town for a while. Thank you so much to everyone at the TKS for making our days with you special.</p>
